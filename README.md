This study examines the impact of the "Hope Brings You Home Down Payment Assistance Program" in Nevada, focusing on its effectiveness in increasing homeownership rates among low-income households in designated distressed areas. Utilizing publicly available mortgage data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the period 2012-2019, the research employs a synthetic control and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to assess the policy's influence.

The synthetic control method provided a pre-treatment match, allowing for estimation of the program's effects. The analysis revealed a significant positive coefficient for the interaction of treatment and post-treatment periods, indicating the policy's positive contribution to homeownership among the targeted demographic.

However, the study faced limitations due to computational constraints, leading to a reduced set of covariates and a limited control pool, potentially affecting the precision of the control match. Additionally, the absence of robustness checks such as permutation tests necessitates cautious interpretation of the results.
